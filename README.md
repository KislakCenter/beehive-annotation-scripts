# Beehive Scripts

This repository contains scripts that can be used to parse annotations as part of the [Digital Beehive Project](http://kislakcenter.github.io/digital-beehive). The scripts will parse a CSV of Beehive annotations and create paths to links for the linked entries section of the Digital Beehive Project.

Technical details on running the scripts is coming soon. For now, most of the code contains documentation on how to use it.
